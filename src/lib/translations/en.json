    "intro_message_0": "In the dawn of time, all of reality was woven from a single symphonyâ€”the Great Harmony.",
    "intro_message_1": "But this music has faded, corrupted by the creeping silence of the Kakophony.",
    "intro_message_2": "The world's song has become a meaningless drone. Yet you are different. You are an Echo, born with the curse and gift of hearing the faint, ghostly melodies of what was lost.",
    "intro_message_3": "Haunted by these phantom sounds, your search for answers has led you here, to the base of the legendary Tower of Vibrato, the last sanctuary of true music.",
    "intro_message_4": "You seek its guardian, Maestro Bethovan, the last master who remembers the true sound of the Weave.",
    "intro_message_5": "As you approach, a voice, powerful and sharp as a trumpet's blast, echoes from the tower's peak...",
    "intro_message_6": "Another stray Echo, drawn to the flame? The Harmony is not a toy! If the simplest dissonance of that creature overwhelms you, you are not worthy of my teachings. Prove you can even tell up from down!",
    "learning_pitch_0": "Pay attention, Echo! The beast's dissonance is not random. It strikes high or low. You must learn to feel the difference.",
    "learning_pitch_1": "First, the High Attack. When its shriek rises in pitch, it aims for your head! You must BEND beneath it. Like this!",
    "learning_pitch_2": "Good. Now, the Low Attack. When its growl falls in pitch, it strikes at your core! You must JUMP over it. Observe!",
    "learning_pitch_3": "Finally, the most dangerous of all. If its focus does not change pitch, it is gathering power for a direct blast! You must BRACE for the impact!",
    "learning_pitch_4": "The lesson is over. Now, face the creature. Do not fail me.",
    "reward_message_0": "Hmph. Not bad. You have a basic sense of pitch...",
    "reward_message_1": "You have learned: Major Third Strike!",
    "reward_message_2": "You have learned: Perfect Fifth Shield!",
    "reward_message_3": "Now the real training begins. Prepare for your first true battle."
